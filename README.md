### :wave: Hello! <a href="https://www.jackgreenberg.co/"><img src="https://www.jackgreenberg.co/images/illustration.png" align="right" height="200" /></a>

My name is Jack. I'm a student @ [Olin College](http://www.olin.edu) studying
electrical and computer engineering. I mostly work in embedded systems and
firmware, writing Rust and C. I'm also experienced in Python and MATLAB for
higher-level projects, and KiCad and general electrical engineering concepts
for hardware projects.
